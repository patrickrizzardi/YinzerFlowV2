# Getting Started with YinzerFlow

YinzerFlow is a lightweight, modular HTTP server framework for Node.js built with TypeScript. It provides a powerful routing system, comprehensive security features, and built-in Pittsburgh personality with flexible logging and configuration options.

## What is YinzerFlow?

YinzerFlow is designed for developers who want:
- **Security-first approach** with built-in protections against common web vulnerabilities
- **TypeScript-first development** with full type safety and IntelliSense support
- **Flexible configuration** for different deployment environments and use cases
- **Pittsburgh personality** with witty logging and error messages
- **Modular architecture** that scales from simple APIs to complex microservices

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Using npm
npm install yinzerflow

# Using Yarn
yarn add yinzerflow

# Using Bun
bun add yinzerflow
```

### Minimal Example

```typescript
import { YinzerFlow } from 'yinzerflow';

// Create a new YinzerFlow instance
const app = new YinzerFlow({ port: 3000 });

// Add a simple route
app.get('/hello', () => {
  return { message: 'Hello, World!' };
});

// Start the server
await app.listen();
// Although you can log the server is started, the built in logging will log this for you already when the server is listening
```

### Basic API Example

```typescript
import { YinzerFlow } from 'yinzerflow';

const app = new YinzerFlow({ port: 3000 });

// GET route with parameters
app.get('/api/users/:id', ({ request }) => {
  const userId = request.params.id;
  const includeProfile = request.query.include_profile;
  
  return {
    id: userId,
    name: 'John Doe',
    includeProfile: !!includeProfile
  };
});

// POST route with body parsing
app.post('/api/users', ({ request }) => {
  const userData = request.body;
  
  return {
    message: 'User created successfully',
    data: userData
  };
});

await app.listen();
```

### Graceful Shutdown

YinzerFlow automatically handles graceful shutdown for SIGTERM and SIGINT signals. No manual setup required:

```typescript
import { YinzerFlow } from 'yinzerflow';

const app = new YinzerFlow({ port: 3000 });

// Add your routes
app.get('/hello', () => {
  return { message: 'Hello, World!' };
});

// Start the server - graceful shutdown is automatically configured
await app.listen();
```

**That's it!** YinzerFlow will automatically:
- Listen for SIGTERM and SIGINT signals
- Log the shutdown process with Pittsburgh personality
- Close the server gracefully
- Exit the process cleanly

For custom shutdown handling, see [Advanced Configuration](./advanced-configuration-options.md).

## Documentation Overview

### Core Features

- **[Routes](./routes.md)** - Comprehensive routing system with HTTP methods, parameters, hooks, and groups
- **[Request Object](./request.md)** - Access headers, body, query parameters, route parameters, and raw body
- **[Response Object](./response.md)** - Set status codes, headers, and return various response types
- **[Body Parsing](./body-parsing.md)** - Secure parsing of JSON, file uploads, and form data with DoS protection

### Security & Configuration

- **[Advanced Configuration](./advanced-configuration-options.md)** - Fine-tune security, performance, and functionality
- **[IP Security](./ip-security.md)** - Client IP validation and spoofing protection for load balancers and CDNs
- **[CORS](./cors.md)** - Cross-Origin Resource Sharing with comprehensive security measures
- **[Logging](./logging.md)** - Flexible logging with custom logger support and Pittsburgh personality

### Common Use Cases

- **API Development**: Create RESTful APIs with automatic body parsing and security
- **File Uploads**: Handle multipart form data with size limits and type validation
- **Authentication**: Implement middleware hooks for token validation and user sessions
- **Rate Limiting**: Add before hooks to limit request frequency and prevent abuse
- **Load Balancer Integration**: Configure trusted proxies for accurate client IP detection
- **Production Monitoring**: Use custom loggers with structured logging and monitoring

## Key Features

### üõ°Ô∏è Security First
- Built-in protection against DoS attacks, prototype pollution, and memory exhaustion
- Automatic security headers and CORS validation
- IP spoofing protection with trusted proxy validation
- Comprehensive input validation and sanitization

### üîß Flexible Configuration
- Configurable body parsing limits and security settings
- Custom logger integration (Winston, Pino, etc.)
- Environment-specific configurations (development, production, high-security)
- Graceful shutdown with connection timeout handling

### üöÄ TypeScript Native
- Full TypeScript support with comprehensive type definitions
- IntelliSense support for all framework features
- Type-safe request/response handling
- Generic support for custom body and response types

### üé≠ Pittsburgh Personality
- Witty logging messages and error handling
- Built-in Pittsburgh-themed personality
- Customizable logging with familiar `log.info()` interface
- Network request logging with nginx-style formatting

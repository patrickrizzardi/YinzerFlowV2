I'll conduct a comprehensive security review of your server implementation. Let me start by exploring the project structure to understand the codebase and then dive deep into potential vulnerabilities.

I've conducted a comprehensive security review of your YinzerFlow web framework implementation. Here's my detailed analysis of critical security vulnerabilities that need immediate attention:

## ðŸš¨ Critical Security Vulnerabilities




### 6. **Information Disclosure in Error Handling**

**Location:** `app/core/execution/RequestHandlerImpl.ts` lines 112-146

**Issues:**
- **Stack traces exposed** - Error details are logged to console and potentially leaked
- **Sensitive error information** - Internal error messages could reveal implementation details

```typescript
// PROBLEMATIC CODE:
console.error('Request handling error:', error); // Logs full error details
console.error('Error handler failed:', errorHandlerError); // More internal details
```

**Fix:** Sanitize error responses:
```typescript
private async handleError(context: InternalContextImpl, error: unknown): Promise<void> {
  // Log internally but don't expose details
  const errorId = crypto.randomUUID();
  console.error(`[${errorId}] Request handling error:`, error);
  
  // Return generic error to client
  context._response._setBody({
    success: false,
    message: 'Internal Server Error',
    errorId: this._configuration.logLevel === 'verbose' ? errorId : undefined
  });
}
```

!! need to ensure the custom logger we created is being used everywhere instead of console.log. Also do the above ^^
